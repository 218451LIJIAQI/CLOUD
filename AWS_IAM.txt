Section 1 key • AWS and the customer share security responsibilities:

• AWS is responsible for security of the cloud
takeaways • Customer is responsible for security in the cloud

• AWS is responsible for protecting the infrastructure—including 
hardware, software, networking, and facilities—that run AWS 
Cloud services

• For services that are categorized as infrastructure as a service 
(IaaS), the customer is responsible for performing necessary 
security configuration and management tasks 

• For example, guest OS updates and security patches, firewall, security group 
configurations

Section 2: AWS Identity and Access 
Management (IAM)
Module 4: AWS Cloud Security

© 2022, Amazon Web Services, Inc. or its affiliates. All rights reserved.



AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)

• Use IAM to manage access to AWS resources –
• A resource is an entity in an AWS account that you can work with

• Example resources; An Amazon EC2 instance or an Amazon S3 bucket

• Example – Control who can terminate Amazon EC2 instances 

• Define fine-grained access rights – AWS Identity and Access 
Management

• Who can access the resource (IAM)

• Which resources can be accessed and what can the user do to the resource

• How resources can be accessed 

• IAM is a no-cost AWS account feature

© 2022, Amazon Web Services, Inc. or its affiliates. All rights reserved. 15



IAM: Essential components

A person or application that can authenticate with an AWS 
account.

IAM user

A collection of IAM users that are granted identical 
authorization.

IAM group

The document that defines which resources can be 
accessed and the level of access to each resource.

IAM policy

Useful mechanism to grant a set of permissions for 
IAM role making AWS service requests. 

© 2022, Amazon Web Services, Inc. or its affiliates. All rights reserved. 16



Authenticate as an IAM user to gain access
When you define an IAM user, you select what types of access the user is permitted to use. 

Programmatic access
• Authenticate using:

• Access key ID

• Secret access key AWS CLI AWS Tools 
and SDKs

• Provides AWS CLI and AWS SDK access

AWS Management Console access
• Authenticate using:

• 12-digit Account ID or alias
AWS Management 

• IAM user name Console
• IAM password

• If enabled, multi-factor authentication (MFA) prompts for an authentication code.

© 2022, Amazon Web Services, Inc. or its affiliates. All rights reserved. 17



IAM MFA

• MFA provides increased security.

• In addition to username and password, MFA requires a unique authentication code to 
access AWS services.

Username and 
password

   

MFA token

Authorization: What actions are permitted

After the user or application is connected to the AWS account, what are they allowed to do?

EC2 instances
Full

access

Read-
IAM user, only S3 bucket

IAM group, 
or IAM role

IAM policies

IAM: Authorization

• Assign permissions by creating an IAM policy.

• Permissions determine which resources and operations are allowed:

• All permissions are implicitly denied by default.

• If something is explicitly denied, it is never allowed.

Best practice: Follow the principle of least privilege.
IAM 

permissions

Note: The scope of IAM service configurations is global. Settings apply across all AWS Regions.

IAM policies

• An IAM policy is a document that defines permissions
• Enables fine-grained access control

• Two types of policies – identity-based and resource-based

• Identity-based policies – IAM entities

• Attach a policy to any IAM entity
• An IAM user, an IAM group, or an IAM role Attach to 

IAM user
one of

• Policies specify:
• Actions that may be performed by the entity

• Actions that may not be performed by the entity IAM policy IAM group

• A single policy can be attached to multiple entities

• A single entity can have multiple policies attached to it IAM role

• Resource-based policies
• Attached to a resource (such as an S3 bucket)

© 2022, Amazon Web Services, Inc. or its affiliates. All rights reserved. 21



IAM policy example

{
Explicit allow gives users access to a specific 

"Version": "2012-10-17",
DynamoDB table and…

"Statement":[{
"Effect":"Allow",
"Action":["DynamoDB:*","s3:*"],
"Resource":[

"arn:aws:dynamodb:region:account-number-without-hyphens:table/table-name",
"arn:aws:s3:::bucket-name", …Amazon S3 buckets.
"arn:aws:s3:::bucket-name/*"] 

}, Explicit deny ensures that the users cannot use any other AWS actions 
{ or resources other than that table and those buckets.
"Effect":"Deny",
"Action":["dynamodb:*","s3:*"],
"NotResource":["arn:aws:dynamodb:region:account-number-without-hyphens:table/table-name”,

"arn:aws:s3:::bucket-name",
"arn:aws:s3:::bucket-name/*"] 

} An explicit deny statement takes precedence
] over an allow statement.

}

Resource-based policies

• Identity-based policies are attached to a 
user, group, or role

• Resource-based policies are attached to a AWS Account
resource (not to a user, group or role)

IAM user S3 bucket 
• Characteristics of resource-based policies – MaryMajor photos

• Specifies who has access to the resource and 
attached Defined inline

what actions they can perform on it on the bucket

• The policies are inline only, not managed

• Resource-based policies are supported only Identity-based Resource-based
by some AWS services policy policy

Policy grants list, Policy grants user 
read objects to the MaryMajor list, read 

photos bucket objects

IAM permissions

How IAM determines permissions:

Is the permission Is the permission 
explicitly denied ? No explicitly allowed ? No Deny

Implicit deny

Yes Yes

Deny Allow

IAM groups

• An IAM group is a collection of IAM users
AWS account

• A group is used to grant the same 
permissions to multiple users

IAM group: IAM group: IAM group:
• Permissions granted by attaching IAM policy or Admins Developers Testers

policies to the group
Carlos Salazar Li Juan Zhang Wei

• A user can belong to multiple groups
Márcia Oliveira Mary Major John Stiles

• There is no default group
Richard Roe Li Juan

• Groups cannot be nested

© 2022, Amazon Web Services, Inc. or its affiliates. All rights reserved. 25



IAM roles

• An IAM role is an IAM identity with specific permissions
• Similar to an IAM user

• Attach permissions policies to it

• Different from an IAM user IAM role

• Not uniquely associated with one person

• Intended to be assumable by a person, application, or service

• Role provides temporary security credentials
• Examples of how IAM roles are used to delegate access –

• Used by an IAM user in the same AWS account as the role 

• Used by an AWS service—such as Amazon EC2—in the same account as the role

• Used by an IAM user in a different AWS account than the role

© 2022, Amazon Web Services, Inc. or its affiliates. All rights reserved. 26



Example use of an IAM role

Scenario: 
AWS Cloud

• An application that runs on an EC2 instance Application has 

needs access to an S3 bucket permissions to 
Amazon EC2 instance access the S3 

bucket

Application
Solution: 3

Amazon S3 

• Define an IAM policy that grants access to Role assumed by bucket

the EC2 instance photos
the S3 bucket. 

• Attach the policy to a role

Section 2 key • IAM policies are constructed with JavaScript Object Notation 
(JSON) and define permissions.

takeaways • IAM policies can be attached to any IAM entity.

• Entities are IAM users, IAM groups, and IAM roles.

• An IAM user provides a way for a person, application, or 
service to authenticate to AWS.

• An IAM group is a simple way to attach the same policies to 
multiple users.

• An IAM role can have permissions policies attached to it and 
can be used to delegate temporary access to users or 
applications.

Encryption of data at rest

• Encryption encodes data with a secret key, which makes it unreadable
• Only those who have the secret key can decode the data

• AWS KMS can manage your secret keys

• AWS supports encryption of data at rest
• Data at rest = Data stored physically (on disk or on tape)

• You can encrypt data stored in any service that is supported by AWS KMS, including:
• Amazon S3

• Amazon EBS

• Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS)

• Amazon RDS managed databases

© 2022, Amazon Web Services, Inc. or its affiliates. All rights reserved. 35



Encryption of data in transit

• Encryption of data in transit (data moving across a network)

• Transport Layer Security (TLS)—formerly SSL—is an open standard protocol 

• AWS Certificate Manager provides a way to manage, deploy, and renew TLS or SSL certificates 

• Secure HTTP (HTTPS) creates a secure tunnel

• Uses TLS or SSL for the bidirectional exchange of data

• AWS services support data in transit encryption. 

• Two examples:

AWS Cloud Corporate data center AWS Cloud

TLS encrypted
data traffic TLS or SSL

Securing Amazon S3 buckets and objects

• Newly created S3 buckets and objects are private and protected by default.

• When use cases require sharing data objects on Amazon S3 –
• It is essential to manage and control the data access.

• Follow the permissions that follow the principle of least privilege and consider using Amazon S3 
encryption.

• Tools and options for controlling access to S3 data include –
• Amazon S3 Block Public Access feature: Simple to use.

• IAM policies: A good option when the user can authenticate using IAM.

• Bucket policies

• Access control lists (ACLs): A legacy access control mechanism.

• AWS Trusted Advisor bucket permission check: A free feature.
