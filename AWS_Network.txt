Networks
• A computer network is two 

or more client machines 
that are connected 
together to share 
resources. 

• A network can be logically 
partitioned into subnets. 

• Networking requires a 
networking device (such as Subnet 1 Subnet 2
a router or switch) to 
connect all the clients Router
together and enable 
communication between 
them.

Section 2: Amazon VPC

Amazon VPC

• Enables you to provision a logically isolated section of the AWS 
Cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that 
you define

Amazon • Gives you control over your virtual networking resources, including:
VPC • Selection of IP address range

• Creation of subnets
• Configuration of route tables and network gateways

• Enables you to customize the network configuration for your VPC
• Enables you to use multiple layers of security

© 2022, Amazon Web Services, Inc. or its affiliates. All rights reserved. 11



VPCs and subnets
• VPCs:

AWS Cloud
• Logically isolated from other VPCs
• Dedicated to your AWS account Region

• Belong to a single AWS Region and can Availability Zone 1 Availability Zone 2

span multiple Availability Zones VPC

• Subnets: Subnet Subnet

• Range of IP addresses that divide a VPC
• Belong to a single Availability Zone
• Classified as public or private

© 2022, Amazon Web Services, Inc. or its affiliates. All rights reserved. 12



IP addressing
• When you create a VPC, you assign it to an 

IPv4 CIDR block (range of private IPv4 VPC
addresses).

• You cannot change the address range after x.x.x.x/16 or 65,536 addresses (max)
you create the VPC. to

• The largest IPv4 CIDR block size is /16. x.x.x.x/28 or 16 addresses (min)

• The smallest IPv4 CIDR block size is /28.
• IPv6 is also supported (with a different 

block size limit).
• CIDR blocks of subnets cannot overlap.

© 2022, Amazon Web Services, Inc. or its affiliates. All rights reserved. 13



Reserved IP addresses

Example: A VPC with an IPv4 CIDR block of 10.0.0.0/16 has 65,536 total IP addresses.
The VPC has four equal-sized subnets. Only 251 IP addresses are available for use by each 
subnet.

Public IP address types
Public IPv4 address Elastic IP address
• Manually assigned through an • Associated with an AWS account

Elastic IP address • Can be allocated and remapped 
• Automatically assigned through the anytime

auto-assign public IP address • Additional costs might apply
settings at the subnet level

Elastic network interface
• An elastic network interface is a virtual network interface that you can:

• Attach to an instance.
• Detach from the instance, and attach to another instance to redirect network traffic.

• Its attributes follow when it is reattached to a new instance.
• Each instance in your VPC has a default network interface that is assigned a private IPv4 

address from the IPv4 address range of your VPC.

Subnet: 10.0.1.0/24

Elastic network interface

Route tables and routes
• A route table contains a set of rules (or 

routes) that you can configure to direct 
network traffic from your subnet. Main (Default) Route Table

Destination Target
• Each route specifies a destination and a 

10.0.0.0/16 local
target. 

• By default, every route table contains a 
local route for communication within the 
VPC.

• Each subnet must be associated with a VPC CIDR block
route table (at most one).

Section 2 key • A VPC is a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud.

takeaways • A VPC belongs to one Region and requires a CIDR block.
• A VPC is subdivided into subnets.
• A subnet belongs to one Availability Zone and requires a 

CIDR block.
• Route tables control traffic for a subnet.
• Route tables have a built-in local route.
• You add additional routes to the table.
• The local route cannot be deleted.

Private subnet: 10.0.2.0/24 the instance level.

Security group

© 2022, Amazon Web Services, Inc. or its affiliates. All rights reserved. 32



Security groups (2 of 2)

• Security groups have rules that control inbound and outbound instance traffic. 
• Default security groups deny all inbound traffic and allow all outbound traffic.
• Security groups are stateful.

Inbound
Source Protocol Port Range Description

sg-xxxxxxxx All All Allow inbound traffic from network interfaces assigned to the 
same security group. 

Outbound
Destination Protocol Port Range Description

0.0.0.0/0 All All Allow all outbound IPv4 traffic.
::/0 All All Allow all outbound IPv6 traffic. 

© 2022, Amazon Web Services, Inc. or its affiliates. All rights reserved. 33



Custom security group examples

• You can specify allow rules, but not deny rules.
• All rules are evaluated before the decision to allow traffic.

Inbound
Source Protocol Port Range Description

0.0.0.0/0 TCP 80 Allow inbound HTTP access from all IPv4 addresses
0.0.0.0/0 TCP 443 Allow inbound HTTPS access from all IPv4 addresses

Your network's public TCP 22 Allow inbound SSH access to Linux instances from IPv4 IP 
IPv4 address range addresses in your network (over the internet gateway) 

Outbound
Destination Protocol Port Range Description

The ID of the security group for TCP 1433 Allow outbound Microsoft SQL Server access to 
your Microsoft SQL Server instances in the specified security group 

database servers

Network access control lists (network ACLs 1 of 2)
AWS Cloud

Region
Availability Zone

VPC: 10.0.0.0/16
Public subnet:10.0.0.0/24

Network ACLs act at 
Private subnet: 10.0.4.0/22 the subnet level.

© 2022, Amazon Web Services, Inc. or its affiliates. All rights reserved. 35



Network access control lists (network ACLs 2 of 2)

• A network ACL has separate inbound and outbound rules, and each rule can 
either allow or deny traffic.

• Default network ACLs allow all inbound and outbound IPv4 traffic.
• Network ACLs are stateless.

Inbound
Rule Type Protocol Port Range Source Allow/Deny
100 All IPv4 traffic All All 0.0.0.0/0 ALLOW

* All IPv4 traffic All All 0.0.0.0/0 DENY

Outbound
Rule Type Protocol Port Range Destination Allow/Deny
100 All IPv4 traffic All All 0.0.0.0/0 ALLOW

* All IPv4 traffic All All 0.0.0.0/0 DENY

© 2022, Amazon Web Services, Inc. or its affiliates. All rights reserved. 36



Custom network ACLs examples

• Custom network ACLs deny all inbound and outbound traffic until you add rules.
• You can specify both allow and deny rules. 
• Rules are evaluated in number order, starting with the lowest number.

Inbound
Rule Type Protocol Port Range Source Allow/Deny
100 HTTPS TCP 443 0.0.0.0/0 ALLOW
120 SSH TCP 22 192.0.2.0/24 ALLOW

* All IPv4 traffic All All 0.0.0.0/0 DENY
Outbound

Rule Type Protocol Port Range Destination Allow/Deny
100 HTTPS TCP 443 0.0.0.0/0 ALLOW
120 SSH TCP 22 192.0.2.0/24 ALLOW

* All IPv4 traffic All All 0.0.0.0/0 DENY

Security groups versus network ACLs

Attribute Security Groups Network ACLs

Scope Instance level Subnet level

Supported Rules Allow rules only Allow and deny rules

State Stateful (return traffic is automatically Stateless (return traffic must be explicitly 
allowed, regardless of rules) allowed by rules)

Order of Rules All rules are evaluated before decision Rules are evaluated in number order before 
to allow traffic decision to allow traffic

Section 4 key • Build security into your VPC architecture:
takeaways • Isolate subnets if possible.

• Choose the appropriate gateway device or VPN 
connection for your needs.

Lab 2: Scenario
In this lab, you use Amazon VPC to create your own VPC and add some 
components to produce a customized network. You create a security group for 
your VPC. You also create an EC2 instance and configure it to run a web server 
and to use the security group. You then launch the EC2 instance into the VPC.

Activity: Design a VPC
Scenario: You have a small business with a website that is hosted on an Amazon Elastic 
Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance. You have customer data that is stored on a backend 
database that you want to keep private. You want to use Amazon VPC to set up a VPC that 
meets the following requirements: 
• Your web server and database server must be in separate subnets.
• The first address of your network must be 10.0.0.0. Each subnet must have 256 total IPv4 

addresses.
• Your customers must always be able to access your web server.
• Your database server must be able to access the internet to make patch updates.
• Your architecture must be highly available and use at least one custom firewall layer.
