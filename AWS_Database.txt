RDS Deployment

• Primary Instance:
• This is the active, main database instance that processes all application queries by default. 
• In a Multi-AZ deployment, it synchronously replicates data to a standby instance for high availability.

• Standby Instance:
• In a Multi-AZ deployment, this is a synchronously maintained, passive copy of the primary instance in a 

different Availability Zone (AZ). 
• It is used for automatic failover in case the primary instance fails and is not directly accessible for traffic.

• Read Replica:
• This is a read-only copy of the primary instance, created to offload read-heavy workloads (like reporting or 

analytics) and improve performance on the primary DB. 
• Data is asynchronously replicated, and can create up to 15 read replicas across or within AWS regions.

When to Use Amazon RDS
Use Amazon RDS when your application • Do not use Amazon RDS when your 
requires: application requires:
• Complex transactions or complex • Massive read/write rates (for example, 

queries 150,000 write/second)

• A medium to high query or write rate – • Sharding due to high data size or 
Up to 30,000 IOPS (15,000 reads + throughput demands 
15,000 writes) • Simple GET or PUT requests and 

queries that a NoSQL database can 
• No more than a single worker node or handle

shard
• Relational database management 

• High durability system (RDBMS) customization

Amazon RDS: Clock-hour billing and database characteristics 
Clock-hour billing – 

• Resources incur charges when running

Database characteristics – 
• Physical capacity of database:

• Engine
• Size
• Memory class

© 2022, Amazon Web Services, Inc. or its affiliates. All rights reserved. 19



Amazon RDS: DB purchase type and multiple DB instances

DB purchase type – 
• On-Demand Instances

• Compute capacity by the hour
• Reserved Instances

• Low, one-time, upfront payment for database instances that are reserved with a 
1-year or 3-year term

Number of DB instances – 
• Provision multiple DB instances to handle peak loads

© 2022, Amazon Web Services, Inc. or its affiliates. All rights reserved. 20



Amazon RDS: Storage
Provisioned storage – 

• No charge
• Backup storage of up to 100 percent of database storage for an active database

• Charge (GB/month)
• Backup storage for terminated DB instances

Additional storage – 
• Charge (GB/month)

• Backup storage in addition to provisioned storage

© 2022, Amazon Web Services, Inc. or its affiliates. All rights reserved. 21



Amazon RDS: Deployment type and data transfer
Requests – 

• The number of input and output requests that are made to the database

Deployment type—Storage and I/0 charges vary, depending on whether you 
deploy to – 

• Single Availability Zone
• Multiple Availability Zones

Data transfer –
• No charge for inbound data transfer 
• Tiered charges for outbound data transfer
