Amazon EBS
Amazon EBS enables you to create individual storage volumes and attach 
them to an Amazon EC2 instance:
• Amazon EBS offers block-level storage.
• Volumes are automatically replicated within its Availability Zone.
• It can be backed up automatically to Amazon S3 through snapshots.
• Uses include – 

• Boot volumes and storage for Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances
• Data storage with a file system
• Database hosts
• Enterprise applications

Amazon EBS: Volumes, IOPS, and pricing
1. Volumes – 

• Amazon EBS volumes persist independently from the instance.
• All volume types are charged by the amount that is provisioned per month.

2. IOPS – 
• General Purpose SSD:

• Charged by the amount that you provision in GB per month until storage is released.
• Magnetic:

• Charged by the number of requests to the volume.
• Provisioned IOPS SSD:

• Charged by the amount that you provision in IOPS (multiplied by the percentage of days 
that you provision for the month).

Amazon EBS: Snapshots and data transfer
3. Snapshots – 

• Added cost of Amazon EBS snapshots to Amazon S3 is per GB-month of 
data stored.

4. Data transfer – 
• Inbound data transfer is free.
• Outbound data transfer across Regions incurs charges.
