Section 1: Microservices and Containers 
Chapter 5: Cloud Application Design



Introduction
• Microservices architectures are not a completely new approach to software 

engineering, but rather a combination of various successful and proven concepts 
such as: 
• Agile software development
• Service-oriented architectures (SOA)
• API-first design 
• Continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD)

• Agile is defined as an iterative software development approach where value is 
provided to users in small increments rather than through a single large launch. 
• Agile teams evaluate requirements and results continuously, which leads to the 

efficient implementation of change.
• SOA development approach uses software components called services to create 

business applications. 
• Each service provides a business capability, and services can also communicate 

with each other across platforms and languages.
• API-first design revolves around the idea that the end product will be consumed by 

mobile devices, and that APIs will be consumed by client applications. 
• An API-first approach involves developing APIs that are consistent and reusable, 

which can be accomplished by using an API description language to establish a 
contract for how the API is supposed to behave. 

• Establishing a contract involves spending more time thinking about the design 
of an API. 

• It also often involves additional planning and collaboration with the 
stakeholders providing feedback on the design of an API before any code is 
written.

• Continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) – is all about Continuous 

Integration, Continuous Delivery, and Continuous Deployment.

What does “microservices” mean?

• Microservices is a  software architecture style in which  complex 
applications are  composed of small, independent  processes 
communicating with  each other using language-agnostic APIs.

• These services are  small, highly decoupled and focus on doing a small 
task, facilitating a modular approach to system building.

• On the logical level, microservice architectures are defined by a
• functional system decomposition into manageable and independently  

deployable components
• Definition:

“In short, the microservice architectural style is an approach to 
developing a  single application as a suite of small services, each running in 
its own process  and communicating with lightweight mechanisms, often an 
HTTP resource API. 

These services are built around business capabilities and independently  
deployable by fully automated deployment machinery. There is a bare  
minimum of centralized management of these services, which may be written 
in different programming languages and use different data storage  
technologies” 

James Lewis and Martin Fowler (2014)



What is Microservices Architecture?

• The term “micro” refers to the sizing: a microservice must be  
manageable by a single development team (5-9 developers).

• Functional system decomposition means vertical slicing (in 
contrast  to horizontal slicing through layers).

• Independent deployability implies no shared state and inter-
process communication (often via HTTP RESTish interfaces).

• Microservice is the first DevOps revolution architectural style 
that embrace engineering practices of Continuous Delivery.

Points about Microservices Architecture

• Each microservice is functionally complete with
• Resource representation
• Data management

• Each microservice handles one resource (or verb), e.g. Clients,  Shop Items, 
Carts, Checkout

• Independent Deployability is key, it enables separation and independent 
evolution of
• code base
• technology stacks
• scaling
• and features, too

• APIs are the front door of microservices, which means that APIs serve as 
the entry point for applications logic behind a set of programmatic 
interfaces, typically a RESTful web services API.
• This API accepts and processes calls from clients, and might implement 

functionality such as traffic management, request filtering, routing, caching, 
authentication, and authorization.

• Continuous integration.

• Code changes are 
frequently merged into the 
main branch.

• Automated build and test 
processes ensure that code 
in the main branch is always 
production-quality.

• Continuous delivery.
• Any code changes that pass 

the CI process are 
automatically published to a 
production-like 
environment.

• Deployment into the live 
production environment 
may require manual 
approval, but is otherwise 
automated.

• The code should always 
be ready to deploy into 
production.

• Continuous deployment.
• Code changes that pass the 

previous two steps are 
automatically deployed into

Kubernetes

• Kubernetes is open source software for container orchestration. 
• Deploy and manage containerized applications at scale.

• The same toolset can be used on premises and in the cloud. 
• Complements Docker.

• Docker enables you to run multiple containers on a single OS host. 
• Kubernetes orchestrates multiple Docker hosts (nodes). 

• Kubernetes automates operational tasks of container 
management and includes built-in commands for deploying 
applications, rolling out changes to your applications, scaling your 
applications up and down to fit changing needs, monitoring your 
applications, and more—making it easier to manage applications.

• Automates –
• Container provisioning. 
• Networking.
• Load distribution.
• Scaling.

Section 2: Application Serverless Architecture 
Chapter 5: Cloud Application Design



Introduction

• Serverless architecture is a software design approach that 
allows developers to build and run applications without 
managing servers or backend infrastructure. 

• The developers write their application code while focusing on 
the business logic at the frontend, and then deploy the code in 
the containers to be managed by a cloud service provider. 

• “Serverless” does not mean that there are no servers. Servers 
are definitely being used, but developers do not concern about 
managing the servers. 

20



Scope and purpose 

• Organisations that aim to reduce costs opt for serverless 
architecture because cloud service providers only charge for the 
time that serverless functions are running. 

• Additionally, these solutions take care of infrastructure 
management chores like capacity provisioning and patching, so 
that engineers and developers can focus completely on 
developing software that benefits the clients. 

• Web applications may scale without any operational concerns if 
switching to serverless architecture. 

21



Basic elements of serverless architecture 

• Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) – FaaS is in charge of carrying out the logic 
that decides how resources are distributed in a particular situation. 

• The client interface – Short bursts of queries, stateless interactions, and 
flexible integrations must all be supported by the interface. Additionally, 
the interface needs to be built to support both very high and low volume 
data transmissions. 

• A web server on the cloud – A stateless interaction will begin on the web 
server after the user does so and continue there until the FaaS service 
cancels it. 

• A security service – Serverless operations place a strong emphasis on 
security. Serverless applications make use of a token service, where users 
can generate temporary credentials to use when calling a function. 

• Backend database – The data that will be shared with the user is kept in 
the backend database. 

• API gateway – Components 1 and 2—namely, FaaS and the client 
interface—are connected by the API gateway. When a user starts an 
action, the API gateway relays it so that the FaaS service can set off an 
event. 

22



Structure of Serverless Architecture

23



Function- as- a- Service (FaaS)
Example: Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) 

Cloud computing service that enables developers to
build, run, and manage application components as
functions without maintaining their own
infrastructure. It is an event-driven execution model
that runs in stateless containers.

The application developers focus on writing
business logic in terms of functions. These functions
run in stateless ephemeral containers and are
triggered by an event and managed entirely by the
third-party vendor.

24



Serverless Architecture Techniques

• Use a compute service to execute code on demand. 

• Write single-purpose, stateless functions. 

• Design push-based, event-driven pipelines. 

• Create thicker, more powerful front ends. 

• Embrace third-party services. 

25



Benefits of Serverless Architecture

Improve the productivity of developers –
developers can simply deploy their code without
having to manage any servers.

Cost effective – cloud service providers only charge
customers when there is execution, so there is no
need to pay for unused servers.

Develop in any language – serverless is a polyglot
environment that accepts code in any language, like
Java, Python, JavaScript.

Simplified scalability – developers do not have to
worry about policies to scale up their code

26

Benefits of serverless 
architecture



Disadvantage of Serverless Architecture

Loss of control – there is lack of control over the software stack
that the code runs on, where when there is any fault on the
server’s side only the cloud service provider can fix it.

Concern on the security – since the servers are shared among
several customers, there can be a breach to the application data if
the shared server is not configured properly.

Unacceptable latency that impacts on the performance – cold
starts (which are common in serverless environment) adds several
seconds of latency when running the code.

Testing and debugging – difficult to do integration testing, which
evaluates the communications between frontend and backend of
the application.

Vendor lock-in – in the serverless environment, cloud service
providers manage all the computing resources. It means that
migrating code to a new cloud provider could be a challenge.
