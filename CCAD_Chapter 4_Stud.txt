Introduction

• Virtualization refers to the act of creating a virtual (rather than 
actual) version of something. 

• It includes virtual computer hardware platforms, operating 
systems, storage devices, and computer network resources. 

• It is able to run multiple operating systems on a single physical 
system and share the underlying hardware resources. 
• Virtual software mimics the functions of physical hardware to run 

multiple virtual machines simultaneously on a single physical machine. 

• Virtualization began in the 1960s, as a method of logically 
dividing the system resources provided by mainframe 
computers between different applications. 

• Businesses use virtualization to use their hardware resources 
efficiently and get greater returns from their investment. 
• It also powers cloud computing services that help organizations 

manage infrastructure more efficiently.

Why is virtualization important?

• By using virtualization, you can interact with any hardware 
resource with greater flexibility. 
• physical servers consume electricity, take up storage space, and need 

maintenance
• often limited by physical proximity and network design if we want to 

access them. 
• virtualization removes all these limitations by abstracting physical 

hardware functionality into software - can manage, maintain, and use 
your hardware infrastructure like an application on the web.

Virtualization Examples

Consider a company that needs Each of these functions has different 
servers for three functions: configuration requirements:

1. Store business email securely 1. The email application requires 
more storage capacity and a 
Windows operating system.

2. Run a customer-facing 
application 2. The customer-facing 

application requires a Linux 
operating system and high 

3. Run internal business processing power to handle 
applications large volumes of website 

traffic.

3. The internal business 
application requires iOS and 

To meet these requirements, the company sets up threemdoiffreere innttdeerdnicaalt emd epmhysoicrayl s(eRrAveMrs )f.or each
application. The company must make a high initial investment and perform ongoing maintenance and
upgrades for one machine at a time.
The company also cannot optimize its computing capacity. It pays 100% of the servers’ maintenance

costs but uses only a fraction of their storage and processing capacities.



Why is virtualization important? (cont.)

• Efficient hardware use
• With virtualization, the company 

creates three digital servers, or virtual 
machines, on a single physical server. 

• It specifies the operating system 
requirements for the virtual machines 
and can use them like the physical 
servers. 

• However, the company now has less 
hardware and fewer related 
expenses.

• Infrastructure as a service
• The company can go one step further 

and use a cloud instance or virtual 
machine from a cloud computing 
provider e.g. AWS.

Virtualisation and Cloud

• In a virtualized environment, computing environments can be 
dynamically created, expanded, shrunk or moved as demand 
varies. 

• Virtualization is extremely well suited to a dynamic cloud 
infrastructure, because it provides important advantages in 
sharing, manageability and isolation
• that is, multiple users and applications can share physical resources 

without affecting one another. 

• One of the initial steps toward Cloud computing is 
incorporating virtualization, which is separating the hardware 
from the software.

Why Cloud Relies on Virtualisation?

• Gives users more control when using the cloud. 

• Allows users to create their own ‘virtual computer’, with 
specified applications, software and operating machines. 
• For example, AWS manages all the underlying hardware, and the 

company can request server resources with varying configurations. All 
the applications run on these virtual servers without the users noticing 
any difference. Server management also becomes easier for the 
company’s IT team.

• Users don't need to worry about what software is being run 
where. 
• This is especially important with clouds, as they won’t often know on 

which machines their data or work will be running.

How is virtualization different from cloud 
computing?

• Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of computing 
resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. 
• Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining a physical data center, you 

can access technology services, such as computing power, storage, and 
databases, as you need them from a cloud provider.

• Virtualization technology makes cloud computing possible. 
• Cloud providers set up and maintain their own data centers. 
• They create different virtual environments that use the underlying 

hardware resources. 
• System could be programmed to access these cloud resources by 

using APIs. The infrastructure needs can be met as a fully managed 
service.

How is server virtualization different from 
containerization?

• Containerization is a way to deploy application code to run on 
any physical or virtual environment without changes. 
• Developers bundle application code with related libraries, 

configuration files, and other dependencies that the code needs to run. 
• This single package of the software, called a container, can run 

independently on any platform. 
• Containerization is a type of application virtualization.

• You can think of server virtualization as building a road to 
connect two places. 
• You have to recreate an entire virtual environment and then run your 

application on it. 
• By comparison, containerization is like building a helicopter that can fly 

to either of those places. 
• Your application is inside a container and can run on all types of 

physical or virtual environments.

11



Virtualisation Characteristics

• Virtualization has 3 characteristics that make it ideal for cloud 
computing: 
• Partitioning

• We can use partitioning to support many applications and 
operating systems (OSes) in a single physical system. 

• Isolation
• Because each virtual machine is isolated, each machine is protected 

from crashes and viruses in the other machines. 
• What makes virtualization so important for the cloud is that it 

decouples the software from the hardware. 

• Encapsulation:
• Encapsulation can protect each application so that it doesn’t 

interfere with other applications. 

• Using encapsulation, a virtual machine can be represented (and 
even stored) as a single file, making it easy to identify and present 
to other applications.

How does virtualization work?
Virtual machines and hypervisors are two important concepts in virtualization.

Hypervisor

• To manage the various aspects of virtualization in cloud 
computing most companies use hypervisors. 

• The hypervisor becomes an ideal delivery mechanism by 
allowing service providers to show the same application on lots 
of different systems. 
• Hypervisors can load multiple operating systems, so they are a very 

practical way of getting things virtualized quickly and efficiently. 
• A hypervisor is an operating system, which means that it knows how to 

act as a traffic cop to make things happen in an orderly manner. 
• The hypervisor sits at the lowest levels of the hardware environment. 
• Because in cloud computing you need to support many different 

operating environments, the hypervisor becomes an ideal delivery 
mechanism. 

17



Hypervisor (cont.)
• Type 1 hypervisor (Native/Bare-metal)

• Is a hypervisor program installed directly on the computer’s hardware instead of the 
operating system with fine-grained timesharing of resources.

• Therefore, type 1 hypervisors have better performance and are commonly used by 
enterprise applications. 

• KVM uses the type 1 hypervisor to host multiple virtual machines on the Linux operating 
system.

(Guest OS)

(Guest OS)

• Type 2 hypervisor (Hosted)
• The type 2 hypervisor is installed on an operating system and suitable for end-user 

computing.
• Provide hosting for websites on virtual servers which pull computing resource from 

extensive underlying networks of physical web servers. 
• Ex. Examples of type 2 Hypervisors include Microsoft Virtual PC, Oracle Virtual Box, VMware 

Workstation, Oracle Solaris Zones, VMware Fusion etc. 
• It relies on the host machine’s OS to undertake certain operations like managing calls to 

the CPU, managing network resources, managing memory and storage. This allows for Type 
2 hypervisors to support a wide range of hardware.

Cloud Provider a Visualisation 
Infrastructure

• Amazon's cloud uses Xen for its virtualization infrastructure.

• Xen Project hypervisor is using microkernel design. 

• Was launched in October 2003 by University of Cambridge 
Computer Laboratory. 

• Leading open source virtualisation platform which is powering 
the biggest players in cloud today. 

• Other cloud providers - RackSpace, OpenStack, Verizon Cloud

Takeaway

• Closely associated with one another, virtualization and cloud 
computing are often mentioned in the same breath. 

• In a nutshell, virtualization is a technology that uses software to 
create virtual versions of a machine’s software and hardware 
components. 

• Clouds are IT environments that utilize virtualization and then 
make those software and hardware components accessible on-
demand.
